## Abstract
Long-term memory is the missing layer for LLM agents: across sessions they forget, and the common workaround -- replaying the whole history into the prompt -- is expensive, slow, and, as distractors accumulate, less accurate. Most memory systems win on cost or latency but still lose to the full-context baseline on accuracy, and benchmark numbers are reported on inconsistent, non-reproducible harnesses, so one system appears at wildly different scores across sources. We present Engram, an open-source, dual-process memory engine on a bi-temporal data model. A fast write path appends lossless episodes with no LLM on the critical path; an asynchronous path extracts atomic (subject, predicate, object) facts, builds a bi-temporal knowledge graph, and resolves contradictions without an LLM call per fact -- invalidating, never deleting, so every fact keeps provenance and a supersession chain. A hybrid read path fuses dense, lexical, graph, and recency/salience signals, applies a point-in-time ("as-of") filter, and assembles a compact, provenance-tagged context. On the full 500-question LongMemEval_S, graded by the official category-specific judge, Engram's lean configuration -- answering from a ~9.6k-token retrieved slice, never the full history -- scores 83.6% vs. 73.2% for full-context (+10.4 points, McNemar p < 10^-6) at ~8x fewer tokens (9.6k vs. 79k), with 0/500 errored. The gain needs a hybrid read path: facts alone lose recall, while facts plus retrieved chunks recover detail. We also contribute a neutral, in-repo evaluation harness with the official judge baked in and the full-context baseline in every table, publish the raw per-question logs, and document the measurement-integrity pitfalls (truncation, home-grown judges, full-history leaks) that silently distort memory benchmarks. Every number ships with a command to reproduce it.
