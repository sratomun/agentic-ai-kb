## Abstract
Traditional ontologies describe domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs lacking structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework synthesizing these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity. Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas constraining LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits, each carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds designs in precedents from existing exemplars. We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, generating complete tabletop game designs, and present three empirical studies. An ablation study (120 designs, 4 conditions) shows multi-agent specialization produces the largest quality gains (fun d=1.12, depth d=1.59; p<.001), while schema validation eliminates structural errors (d=4.78). A benchmark against 20 published board games reveals structural parity but a bounded creative gap (fun d=1.86): generated designs score 7-8 while published games score 8-9. A test-retest study (50 evaluations) validates the LLM-based evaluator, with 7/9 metrics achieving Good-to-Excellent reliability (ICC 0.836-0.989). The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars is a candidate for Generative Ontology.
