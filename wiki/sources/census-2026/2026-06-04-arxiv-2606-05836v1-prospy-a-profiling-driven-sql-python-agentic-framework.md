## Abstract
Large language models have substantially advanced Text-to-SQL systems, yet applying them to enterprise-scale databases remains challenging. Real-world databases often contain large and heterogeneous schemas, incomplete metadata, dialect-specific SQL syntax, and complex analytical questions that are difficult to solve with a single SQL query. To address these challenges, we propose ProSPy, a Profiling-driven SQL--Python agentic framework for enterprise-scale Text-to-SQL. ProSPy structures the reasoning process into four stages: it first extracts fine-grained data evidence through automatic profiling, progressively prunes large schemas into task-relevant contexts, fetches intermediate views through a dialect-agnostic SQL interface, and finally performs flexible downstream analysis with Python. This design combines the efficiency of SQL over large databases with the flexibility of Python-based analysis, while reducing reliance on unreliable metadata and improving robustness across SQL dialects. Experiments on Spider 2.0-Lite and Spider 2.0-Snow show that ProSPy consistently outperforms strong baselines with both open-source and proprietary models, achieving execution accuracies of 60.15% and 60.51% with Claude-4.5-Opus, without majority voting. Further analysis shows that ProSPy is robust to SQL dialect variations and achieves a favorable trade-off between schema recall and precision.
