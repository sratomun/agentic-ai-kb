## Abstract
Current stateless defences for multimodal agentic RAG fail to detect adversarial strategies that distribute malicious semantics across retrieval, planning, and generation components. We formulate this security challenge as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where adversarial intent is a latent variable inferred from noisy multi-stage observations. We introduce MMA-RAG^T, an inference-time control framework governed by a Modular Trust Agent (MTA) that maintains an approximate belief state via structured LLM reasoning. Operating as a model-agnostic overlay, MMA-RAGT mediates a configurable set of internal checkpoints to enforce stateful defence-in-depth. Extensive evaluation on 43,774 instances demonstrates a 6.50x average reduction factor in Attack Success Rate relative to undefended baselines, with negligible utility cost. Crucially, a factorial ablation validates our theoretical bounds: while statefulness and spatial coverage are individually necessary (26.4 pp and 13.6 pp gains respectively), stateless multi-point intervention can yield zero marginal benefit under homogeneous stateless filtering when checkpoint detections are perfectly correlated.
