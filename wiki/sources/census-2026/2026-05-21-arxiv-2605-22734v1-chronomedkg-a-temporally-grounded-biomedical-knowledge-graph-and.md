## Abstract
Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) treat disease associations as static facts, but temporal information is crucial for clinical reasoning, e.g., a symptom diagnostic of one disease at age 3 may imply a different disease at age 13. Existing KGs such as PrimeKG, Hetionet, and iKraph do not encode when a finding becomes clinically relevant over the course of a disease. This limits their usefulness for longitudinal clinical reasoning and retrieval augmentation. We introduce ChronoMedKG, a temporal biomedical knowledge graph that contains 460,497 evidence-linked triples (filtered from 13M raw extractions) covering 13,431 diseases. Each association is tied to temporal components like onset window or progression stage, which are backed by PMID-traceable evidence and a multi-signal credibility score. The graph is constructed through a disease-autonomous multi-agent pipeline in which multiple frontier LLMs independently extract knowledge from PubMed and PMC literature. Only those relations are kept that are supported by multi-model consensus, survive credibility filtering, as well as ontology alignment. ChronoMedKG scored 92.7% agreement against Orphadata and adds temporal grounding for 6,250 diseases absent from HPOA, Orphadata, and Phenopackets, including 1,657 Orphanet-coded rare diseases. We further introduce ChronoTQA, a benchmark of 3,341 questions across eight task types (six temporal plus two static controls), with a 12-question supplementary probe. Frontier LLMs lose roughly 30 points moving from static to temporal questions; ChronoMedKG retrieval rescues 47-65% of their long-tail failures, against 17-29% for HPOA-RAG. As such, ChronoMedKG provides a crucial temporal axis for retrieval-augmented clinical systems that was previously absent.
