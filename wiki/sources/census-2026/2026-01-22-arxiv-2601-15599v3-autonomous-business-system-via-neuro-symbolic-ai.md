## Abstract
Modern business environments demand continuous reconfiguration of cross-functional processes, yet most enterprise systems remain organized around siloed departments, rigid workflows, and hard-coded automation. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in interpreting natural language and synthesizing unstructured information, but they lack deterministic, auditable execution of complex business logic. We introduce Autonomous Business System (AUTOBUS), a system that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a unified neuro-symbolic architecture for executing end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models a business initiative as a network of interrelated tasks with explicit pre- and post-conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph, whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules that ground reasoning and ensure semantic consistency. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and produces deterministic outcomes. Humans specify task instructions, define and maintain business semantics and policies, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the structure of AI-generated logic programs, and the human-AI collaboration model and present a case study that demonstrates accelerated time to market in a data-rich organization. A reference implementation of the case study is available at https://github.com/cecilpang/autobus-paper.
